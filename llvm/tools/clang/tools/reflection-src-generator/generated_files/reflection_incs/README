Once these are generated, you must manually copy them into lib/Sema/reflection_incs, and recompile clang (this
 second build should be pretty quick relative to the initial build, since no headers are modified).

If it compiles and the reflection tests pass (TODO, tests do not exist yet), copy the reflection.hpp file to the location where clients using this newly compiled clang can #include it.  Delete any old reflection.hpp to avoid confusion.

If you encounter an error during compilation, you should be able to get clang to compile again, minus reflection,
by copying the contents of blank_reflection_incs to the lib/Sema/reflection_incs folder.
